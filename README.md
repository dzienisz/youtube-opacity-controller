2. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar

3. Use the slider to adjust the opacity:
   - **0%** = Completely transparent (invisible)
   - **50%** = Half transparent
   - **100%** = Fully opaque (no transparency)

4. Or use the quick preset buttons:
   - **Fully Opaque** (100%) - No transparency at all

## What It Controls

This extension modifies the opacity of **inner elements** within YouTube's player that are semi-transparent, including:

- Player control buttons (play, pause, volume, settings, etc.)
- Progress bar and time displays
- Video title and channel name overlays
- SVG icons within buttons
- Tooltips and chapter titles
- Menu panels and settings
- Gradient overlays (top and bottom)
- Channel watermark
- Cards and end screen elements
- All other semi-transparent UI elements within the player

The extension intelligently detects and modifies ANY element with reduced opacity (< 100%) within the YouTube player container.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?

1. Refresh the YouTube page after installing the extension
2. Make sure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Check that you're on a YouTube video page (not the homepage)

### Changes not appearing?

- Some overlay elements may load dynamically. Try pausing and playing the video.
- The extension works best when you adjust the opacity while the video is playing.
