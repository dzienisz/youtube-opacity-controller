Update to version 1.1 - Bug Fix Release

This is a minor update that fixes critical layout issues affecting user experience:

1. Fullscreen button was misaligned due to CSS style overwriting
2. Progress bar scrubber (red dot) was hidden under black background
3. Some buttons lost their original positioning

Technical changes:
- Changed from using cssText (which overwrites all styles) to setProperty()
  (which only modifies specific CSS properties)
- This preserves YouTube's native layout styles while applying our backgrounds
- No new permissions requested
- No functionality changes - only bug fixes
- Fully tested on multiple YouTube videos

No changes to:
- Privacy policy (still no data collection)
- Permissions (same as v1.0)
- Core functionality
- User interface

This update improves stability and compatibility with YouTube's player.
```
