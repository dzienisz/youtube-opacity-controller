## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Google Chrome (or Chromium-based browser)
- Git
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Understanding of Chrome Extension APIs

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/youtube-opacity-controller.git
   cd youtube-opacity-controller
   ```

2. **Load Extension in Chrome**
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the project folder

3. **Make Changes**
   - Edit files as needed
   - Click reload button in `chrome://extensions/` to test changes
   - Test on YouTube videos

4. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Use the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) checklist
   - Test in different scenarios (normal, theater, fullscreen)
   - Verify all buttons and controls work
   - Check different opacity levels

## üìù Code Style

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed
- Avoid `var`

### Example:
```javascript
// Good
const DEFAULT_OPACITY = 0.7;
let currentOpacity = DEFAULT_OPACITY;

// Apply opacity to player container
function applyOpacity(opacity) {
  // Implementation...
}

// Bad
var opacity = 0.7;
var o = opacity;

function apply(x) {
  // What is x?
}
```

### CSS
- Use descriptive class names
- Keep specificity low
- Use `!important` sparingly (only when necessary to override YouTube styles)
- Add comments for non-obvious rules

### File Organization
- Keep `content.js` focused on DOM manipulation
- Keep `popup.js` focused on UI logic
- Separate concerns clearly
